# Love-Rosie - Developer Portfolio

**Love-Rosie** is a responsive developer portfolio project built with **Bootstrap 5**. The project showcases a developer's skills, projects, and contact information in a clean, modern design. 

> **Note**: The original video tutorial for this portfolio was done using **Bootstrap 4**. However, I am leveraging my soft skills and thorough understanding of documentation to successfully implement the project using **Bootstrap 5**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly to any screen size, making it accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Bootstrap 5 Framework**: Utilises the latest version of Bootstrap for easy customization and fast development.
- **Skills Showcase**: Highlight thetechnical skills with an attractive layout.
- **Project Portfolio**: Display the top projects with descriptions, images, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form**: Allow potential clients or employers to get in touch directly via a built-in form.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes buttons, hover effects, and icons to enhance user engagement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic understanding of web development.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Familiarity with Bootstrap is a plus but not required.
